	<h1>NFL DRAFT 2023 </h1>
	<h2>Overview </h2>

	<p> 2023 is a unique draft. With quarterback questions all across the league, there's likely to be lots of movement at the top of the board, especially because the Bears, who are picking at #1, don't need a quarterback. Will the Bears stay put and take the best player available or trade back for more draft capital? Which team will mortgage their future for one of these top QB prospects? Will Bryce Young go #1 or will it be hyper-athletic prospect Anthony Richardson? We will find out the answers to these questions on April 27th in Kansas City. </p>
